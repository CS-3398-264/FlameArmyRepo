360 evaluation

during SRS and SDD, we dont really get benefit from it because it is challenging that everyone coordinating every class into 1 package.
moreover, the SRS and SDD also increse the cost of time to make the product. it may be more unorganized as for a relatively easy project.

we believe that the waterfall process has to be very prepared at the begining and have a more restricted schedule. We do experience that
the downside of the waterfall process since we have connection issues among the team. that delay the schedule a lot.
