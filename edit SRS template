 1.1	Purpose
 The purpose of this document is to present a detailed description of a chess game called ChessMate. It will explain the features
 of the system, the interface of the system, and how the system will interact with the end user.

 Rook:	Four pieces on the board (2 per team), that may be moved any number squares horizontally or vertically, as long as no
       other piece blocks its way.
 Pawn:	Eight pieces per team and consequnetly the piece with the lowest capture value, usually moved one square at a time vertically and capturing diagonally, although it can move
 2 spaces vertically if it is its first move.
 Bishop:	2 pieces per team that may be moved any number squares diagonally, as long as no other piece blocks its way. 
       One piece always remains on White squares and the other always on Black.

 The product shall be able to deliver a complete experience of a game of chess with an AI opponent or
 with another player on the same computer system. The game will allow the user to control chess pieces in two different forms,
 mouse or user input. The end goal is to allow an experienced chess player to practice certain strategies and move possibilities,
 it is not intended for a competitive setting.


1.3	Intended Audience and Reading Suggestions
  
  The project shall be available to the following audience:

 AI: (Nityam's slack share link detail), in order to create a AI oppenent, by professor Diaz's premitation, 
      we are allowed to use online resources instead of creating our own AI configuration.
      
1.6	Product Perspective 
ChessMate will be the first version of a chess game design. It is intented to work as a stand alone system.

The program shall meet the following requirements

      1.	A user interface (ASCII text is fine, sprites, html images, etc.).      
      2.	There must be at least ONE form of AI implementation       
      3.	There must be user input      
      4.	The game must begin from the normal starting position and must complete when it has determined check mate.
      5.	You MAY use libraries/APIs, but you MAY NOT copy code.      
      6.	All documentation and code must be pushed to GitHub by everyone as they complete work.


1.8	User Classes and Characteristics
  Intermideate Chess Player: The user must be an experienced chess player. The user must know how to play
  chess before attempting to play the game since it will not provide the user hints to making moves.
  
1.9	Operating Environment
   The game will operate on windows 7 or higher version.


2.0	User Documentation

 A button will be available to show the rules for any piece the user decides to check, including the moves it can make.
 
               
External Interface Requirements

2.1	User Interfaces

The chess board will be black and while. Each piece will have the same color of it's corresponding team, either black or white.
Any errors that the user makes will be displayed in a text field containing the error summary. If the user
does the same error twice, a pop up screen will be displayed for the user to acknowledge.

 
2.5	Hardware Interfaces

  When the User is utilizing the product, the Hardware shall able to:
                      
                      1. allow the game to support mouse click interaction(left/right click)
                      2. use mouse to interact with all tab options (start the game, surrender...)
                      3. use mouse to interact with the chess and the avilable places to move.
                      4. use mouse to close the game.

2.6	Software Interfaces
  Developing language: Java.
  
2.7	Communications Interfaces
    No communication interfaces will be necessary since the player will be playing against an AI
    or a player in the same system.

2.8 Text interaction Interfaces(Product logic desing test) 
    By using chess notation, we display the notation (maybe grid by grid) of the game user input and output to perfrom the 
    logic of the game and test that the classes and functions are correct.
    an idea example: 
                     game start!
                     move: pawn1 // input
                     move to : a5 // another input 
                     display : cant move to ther cause "   " choose another move (Bool check)
                     move: pawn 1 // input
                     move to : a3 // input
                     display: sucess, move pawn 1 to a3 // display move
                     display: r k b K q b k r
                              p p p p p p p p
                              . . . . . . . .
                              . . . . . . . .
