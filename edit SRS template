 1.1	Purpose 
  Using Java/HTML-5(need to discuss), "Created a Game of Chess" with:
                                      1. Correct Chess Rule 
                                      2. Correct Chess class
                                      3. Correct way to move different type of chess
                                      4. An AI opponent
                                      5. Score board
                                      6. Move timer? (What will be the AI respond period?)
                                      7. Standard or other verify rule
                                      8. Move log- able to show move recorder 
                                      9. Able to detemine the winning situitation.
                                     
                                    With Test Plan and Test Result, list of record-defects 
                                    
Also , meet these requirment listed from the Project +1 doc from tracs

      1.	A user interface (ASCII text is fine, sprites, html images, etc.).      
      2.	There must be at least ONE form of AI implementation (up to user and sophistication is not critical).      
      3.	There must be user input (again, can be from a command prompt, mouse click, etc.).      
      4.	The game must begin from the normal starting position 
          and must complete when it has determined check mate.
      5.	You MAY use libraries/APIs, but you MAY NOT copy code.      
      6.	All documentation and code must be pushed to GitHub by everyone 
          as they complete work (exceptions need to be run by me).
