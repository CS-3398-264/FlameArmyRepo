Team Analysis

During the SRS and SDD phases, we didnt really get to benefit from them because it was challenging coordinating all of the group members to work together.
Moreover, the SRS and SDD also increase the time to make the product. It may be more unorganized for a relatively easy project such as this one. Since we 
experienced the problems mentioned above, it was very hard for the members to visualize the code to be produced and so the team
came up with code very late in the process of this project due to this obstacle. 

We believe that the waterfall process has to be well prepared and organized from the begining and have a detailed schedule 
that everyone can agree on. We did realize the downsides of the waterfall process very quickly since we had communication issues 
throughout the project among the team that delayed the process greatly. Thus we conclude that we need more monitoring and attention either 
from the team or the individual responsible for the monitoring in order to keep everything on schedule.

For Submition purpose, certain teammate upload the entire part of project such as SRS SDD, Code, and TestPlan.
