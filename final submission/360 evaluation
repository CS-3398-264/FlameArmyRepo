360 evaluation

during SRS and SDD, we dont really get benefit from it because it is challenging that everyone coordinating every class into 1 package.
moreover, the SRS and SDD also increse the cost of time to make the product. it may be more unorganized as for a relatively easy project.

We believe that the waterfall process has to be very prepared at the begining and have a more restricted schedule. We do experience that
the downside of the waterfall process since we have connection issues among the team. that delay the schedule a lot. thus we think that we need
more monitoring either from the team or individual in order to keep everything on schedule.

For Submition purpose, certain teammate upload the entire part of project such as SRS SDD. to see the contribution,
